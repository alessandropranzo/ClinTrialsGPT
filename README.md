# ClinTrialsGPT v1.0

**Harness the power of LLMs to synthesize and reason over live clinical trial data -â€” bridging trial evidence and insight in real time!**

Tl;dr. Quick installation: `docker run -p 8501:8501 vinbhaskara/clintrialsgpt:latest`

Chat just as you would with ChatGPT -- except that any query relevant to clinical trials will trigger an API call to the ClinicalTrials.gov database with relevant search terms inferred from the user's query (i.e. "agentic retrieval"). The responses to queries are grounded in the clinical trial data retrieved with appropriate citations.
